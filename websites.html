        A classic website which many used, I was on this website more than my own and YouTube tutorials. Information like linking websites, making custom percentage bars, just so many things.

        I absolutely could not have done that page from scratch, I have much to learn! Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/myantalgik"><strong>myantalgik!</strong></a> on Github for coming through. It took me while especially since I wanted to edit it and customize it for my means. I learned a lot of how divs stack and CSS manipulation reading/edit that code.

        This was a difficult process and I am incredibly grateful especially to Kehinde for sharing an app in which I made my character and Joshuan who shared his font and among other things. Thank you to the TAs who struggled with me figuring out the ugliest code in existence!
